Leaderboard

Test project using HandlerThread and getLooper to get a better understanding of how it works.

This app creates a leaderboard of teams with random names and skills. It executes the matches between them where each team face each other twice once as local and another one as visitor.

It uses a HandlerThread to register teams, execute matches and inform the UI of the results to update the leaderboard.
It is still in development and will be used to try out new techniques to improve performance.

Contributions, suggestions or any kind of feedback is welcome.
